# cpybuild
CPyBuild is a lightweight, ground-up Python build tool that automates packaging your Python project into deployable wheel distributions. This tool scans source files, compiles bytecode, generates metadata, and creates standard Python wheel packages without relying on existing build systems, giving full control over the build process.
